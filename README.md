## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Building more foundation! Learned about line spacing which was a new concept for me to code. 

h1{
    font-size: 24px;
    margin: 0.75rem 0;
   
}
h1:hover{
    cursor: pointer;
    color: var(--Yellow)
}
This is the code used for the hover action! I'm just happy with how I was able to make this simple.


### Continued development

I want to eventually learn more about exact spacing. I haven't been aiming for pixel perfext spaces just more of general spacing using common sizes with rem. I'd like to learn how to go about getting the card to match with the example with pixel precision. 
### Useful resources

- [CSS resource ](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_line-height.php) - 
The absolute GOAT when learning CSS. Pretty much using it as a guide.
